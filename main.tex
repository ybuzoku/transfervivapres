\section{Approaching substructurality in Base-extention Semantics}
\begin{frame}{Substructural atomic derivability}
\begin{definition}[Basic rules]
Basic rules take the following form: 
\[\openaddrule (\at{P}_{1_i} \seq \at{q}_{1_i})\closeaddrule^{l_1}_{i=1}, \dots, \openaddrule (\at{P}_{n_i} \seq \at{q}_{n_i})\closeaddrule^{l_n}_{i=1} \Rightarrow \at{r}\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item Each $P_i$ is an atomic multiset, called a premiss multiset.
\item Each $q_i$ and $r$ is an atomic proposition.
\item Each $(P_i \seq q_i)$ is a pair $(P_i, q_i)$ called an atomic sequent.
\item Each collection $\openaddrule (\at{P}_{i_1} \seq \at{q}_{i_1}), \dots, (\at{P}_{i_{l_i}} \seq \at{q}_{i_{l_i}})\closeaddrule$ is called an atomic box.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
%\pause
%\emph{Given derivations of $q_{i_j}$ from $P_{i_j}$ relative to some multisets $C_i$ one infers $r$ relative to all $C_i$, discharging from the derivations in question, the premiss atomic multisets $P_{i_j}$.} 
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Substructural atomic derivability}
\begin{definition}[Basic derivability relation]
The relation of derivability in a base $\baseB$, is defined inductively as so:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Ref] $p \deriveBaseM{\baseB} p$
\item[App] Given that $(\openaddrule(\at{P}_{1_i} \seq \at{q}_{1_{i}})\Closeaddrule{i=1}{l_1},\dots,\openaddrule(\at{P}_{n_i} \seq \at{q}_{n_{i}}) \Closeaddrule{i=1}{l_n} \Rightarrow \at{r}) \in \baseB$ and atomic multisets $\at{C}_i$ such that the following hold:
        \[\at{C}_i\msetsum \at{P}_{i_j} \deriveBaseM{\baseB} \at{q}_{i_j} \text{ for all } i = 1,\dots, n \text{ and } j = 1,\dots,l_i\]
Then $\at{C}_{1}\msetsum\dots\msetsum\at{C}_{n}\deriveBaseM{\baseB} r$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Expanding what we know}
\begin{center}
Considering the case when $\varphi = \at{p}$ for simplicity we get the following:
\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item Given a base $\baseB$ such that $\deriveBaseM{\baseB}\at{p}$ and $L=\emptymultiset$.
\pause
\item Then we have that $\suppM{\baseB}{L}\at{p} \mand \ldots \mand \at{p}$.
\pause
\item Examples of such bases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\baseB = \{\emptymultiset \Rightarrow \at{p}\}$
	\item $\baseB = \{\emptymultiset \Rightarrow \at{q},\, \at{q}\Rightarrow \at{p} \}$
\end{itemize}
\pause
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{10pt}
Note that if $L \neq \emptymultiset$ then the only way that this relation could hold is if the atoms were derivable from within the base, i.e. if were valid $\suppM{\baseB}{\emptymultiset}L$.

So ultimately, $\suppM{\baseB}{\emptymultiset}p\mand \ldots \mand p$.

\begin{frame}{A proof-theoretic flavour of the $\bang$}
	We now consider the second identity: $\suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang(\varphi\aand\psi)$ iff $\suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang\varphi \mand \bang\psi$
	with $\psi = \top$. Furthermore since $\varphi\aand\top \equiv \varphi$ we go as follows:
	\begin{align}
		\suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang\varphi &\text{ iff } \suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang\varphi \mand \bang\top \\
		&\text{ iff for all } \baseC\baseGeq\baseB, K \text{ and } p\in\At,\bang\varphi\msetsum\bang\top\suppM{\baseC}{K}p\text{ implies }\suppM{\baseC}{L\msetsum K}p\\

	\end{align}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Some failed attempts}
\begin{itemize}
\item The most convincing hypothesis was that $\suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang\varphi$ iff $L = \emptymultiset$ and for all $\baseC \baseGeq \baseB$, atomic multisets $K$ and atoms $p$, if $\varphi\suppM{\baseC}{K}p$ then $\suppM{\baseC}{K}p$.
\pause
\item This however fails to be complete as it requires us to be able to prove from $L \deriveBaseM{\baseB} \flatIMALL{(\bang \varphi)}$ that $L = \emptymultiset$, to pass Proposition 31.
\pause
\item Attempts to generalise this by replacing $L=\emptymultiset$ with $\suppM{\baseB}{\emptymultiset}L$ fail for the same reason.
\pause
\item A different attempt, based on a notion of closure was to define $\suppM{\baseB}{L}\bang \varphi$ iff for every $K, p$ and $\baseC \baseGeq \baseB$ if we have $\varphi\suppM{\baseC}{K}p$ then $\suppM{\baseC}{L,K}p$ and $\Quinequote{\forall}M(\suppM{\baseB}{M}\varphi\, \Quinequote{\Rightarrow}\suppM{\baseB}{\emptymultiset}M)$ also fails as there is no way to prove the conclusion of the second conditional.

\begin{frame}{Future directions of work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Study how rules are generally translated from Sandqvists bases for IPL to the bases I presented here.
		\item Give a Proof-theoretic Semantics for Classical Linear Logic.
		\item Similarly, study other similar logics such as DILL, FILL and what happens when we have subexponentials.
		\item Give a categorical interpretation of the semantics presented herein.
		\item Investigate the connection to Linear Logic programming.
		\item Develop a connection to the Kripke semantics of Miller for his fragment of ILL.
	\end{itemize}
